# Implementation of an I2C Communication Network in Verilog
This Vivado project folder contains the design source files implementing the master and slave nodes on an I2C network, along with multiple simulation testbench sources. 
## What is I2C? 
I2C or Inter-Integrated Circuit is a half-duplex, serial, bidirectional communication protocol. It is primarily used for data transfers across multiple ICs on the same PCB, and short distnce communication. This low-level communication system consists of two bidirectional lines that are connected to Vcc via a pull-up resistor, with all the master and slave nodes utilizing the same two lines for communication.
